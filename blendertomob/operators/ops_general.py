    Stock ``object.delete`` removes only the selected objects, which leaves
    orphaned children behind when the selection is an HB5 cage or part, and
    never runs the cleanup an HB5 asset needs (wall miter recompute,
    neighbor constraint removal, etc.). This operator classifies the active
    object and dispatches:

    - face frame cabinet  -> hb_face_frame.delete_cabinet
    - closet starter      -> hb_closets.delete_starter
    - closet bay cage     -> hb_closets.delete_bay
    - closet opening cage -> hb_closets.clear_opening (openings are
      structural in closets; the reconciler owns their lifecycle)
    - closet part         -> hb_closets.delete_part (config-aware)
    - frameless cabinet   -> hb_frameless.delete_cabinet
    - frameless appliance -> hb_frameless.delete_appliance

    - wall                -> home_builder_walls.delete_wall
    - anything else       -> object.delete

    Each HB5 delete operator already sweeps ``selected_objects`` for its own
    kind, so multi-select delete (several cabinets, several walls) works
    without extra handling here - the active object only decides which kind
    is targeted. Mixed selections delete the active object's kind only.

    The cabinet, appliance, and door/window checks all run before the wall
    check on purpose: those assets sit in the wall's parent chain (a door
    or window BP is a direct child of the wall BP), so the wall test would
    otherwise misfire and delete the whole wall instead of the asset on it.
