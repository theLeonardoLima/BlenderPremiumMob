Pass 1: computes rail and stile widths for an applied panel so it
reads as a visual continuation of the cabinet front. For PANELED with
a 5-piece door style, factors door overlay + door stile/rail widths
into the panel widths so the panel + door together would have looked
like one continuous frame had a door been mounted on the side. For
SLAB doors, no door style, or WORKING_FF / FALSE_FF (where the
"panel" is an applied face frame, not a panel), copies cabinet face
frame widths to the panel directly.
