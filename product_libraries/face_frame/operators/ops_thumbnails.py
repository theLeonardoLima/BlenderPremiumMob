"""Batch thumbnail rendering for built-in face frame catalog items.

Maintenance operator, not part of the end-user flow. For each renderable
catalog entry it builds the real cabinet in a throwaway scene, renders a
workbench preview into face_frame_thumbnails/, then tears the scene down.
The resulting PNGs are committed to the repo so users get them shipped.

Only catalog names with a genuine builder are listed: get_cabinet_class
falls back to a plain base cabinet for any unrecognized name, so an
explicit allowlist is the safeguard against rendering misleading images.
