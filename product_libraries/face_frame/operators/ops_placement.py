"""Modal placement operator for face frame cabinets.

Drags a wireframe preview cage around the scene during placement; the
real cabinet is built only on commit, so cancel cleanly removes the
preview without leaving construction debris.

Behaviors:
  * Cursor follows mouse; wall is detected by raycast, with a fallback
    to nearest-wall-by-floor-projection so a missed raycast at a
    grazing angle doesn't unstick from the wall (prevents flicker).
  * Front/back side decision uses hysteresis - a 1" tolerance band
    around the wall centerline before flipping sides. Without this,
    sub-pixel cursor wobble at the wall surface flickers between front
    and back placement.
  * On a wall: cabinet width = available gap (between neighbors and
    wall ends), parented to wall, slid along its X axis. Bay quantity
    auto-fits the gap unless the user has overridden it via arrow keys.
  * Off a wall: cabinet width = scene's default_cabinet_width, bay
    quantity stays at the user's last value.
  * Up/down arrows: manually adjust bay quantity (1-10).
  * Click commits, Esc/right-click cancels.

The cage uses Mirror Y on its GeoNodeCage input. Default cage extends
+Y from origin, but face-frame cabinets extend -Y from origin (origin
at the back face). Mirror Y flips the cage to extend -Y too, so cage
position == cabinet position with no offset gymnastics.

The cage is flagged HB_CURRENT_DRAW_OBJ so hb_snap raycasts skip it
(prevents self-snap).

    the left arm (perpendicular to its length axis), not its length;
    the length is the cabinet's overall depth.

    Continuing a cabinet run "to the left" of a corner cabinet means
    continuing along the perpendicular wall - which requires the new
    cabinet to be rotated 90 CCW relative to the corner cabinet so
    its back faces the perpendicular wall, and offset so its right
    edge lands at the end of the left arm.

    Math in the corner cabinet's local frame:
      - Origin at (0, -(corner_depth + new_object_width), 0).
        After +90 CCW rotation, the new cabinet's local +X axis
        maps to corner-local +Y direction, so its right edge
        (local x = new_object_width) lands at corner-local
        y = -corner_depth - the end of the left arm.
      - Rotation: corner's Z rotation + pi/2

    Uses matrix_world (not local loc/rot) so it is correct whether the
    corner cabinet is free-standing OR parented to a wall - the latter
    lets a peninsula run snap off a wall-mounted corner's left return.

    Returns (Vector, Euler) world-space, or None if corner depth
    isn't readable.
