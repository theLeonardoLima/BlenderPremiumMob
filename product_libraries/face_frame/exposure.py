"""Side exposure detection for face frame cabinets.

For each face-frame cabinet, computes per-side exposure state
(UNEXPOSED / PARTIAL / EXPOSED) and a dishwasher-adjacent flag by
walking parent-wall siblings and comparing Z-bands. Then resolves the
finished-end-condition per side per the priority rule (dishwasher
wins, then partial, then full, then unexposed) - but only on sides
that still have the auto flag enabled.

Wall-edge handling is intentionally simple: a cabinet sitting at the
parent wall's start or end is treated as UNEXPOSED on that side
(perpendicular wall / corner case). Free-end peninsulas will need a
manual override; the user can clear the auto flag and pick a type.

Back exposure is reduced to UNEXPOSED-when-wall-parented; partial
backs don't show up in practice.
