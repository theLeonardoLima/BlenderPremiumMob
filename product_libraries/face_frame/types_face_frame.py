"""Face frame cabinet construction classes.

Phase 3a deliverable: class hierarchy and a minimal carcass build.
- FaceFrameCabinet: base class for all face frame cabinets. No drivers.
  All dimension propagation runs through cabinet.recalculate().
- BaseFaceFrameCabinet, UpperFaceFrameCabinet, TallFaceFrameCabinet,
  LapDrawerFaceFrameCabinet: subclasses with type-specific defaults.
- FaceFrameBay: bay cage object (Phase 3b will populate bay contents).

Carcass conventions match frameless (same CabinetPart GeoNode setup):
- Cabinet origin at back-left, floor level
- +X is right, -Y is forward (depth runs in -Y), +Z is up
- Back panel sits at y=0; front of cabinet is at y=-depth
- Mirror Y=True on a part means it extrudes in -Y from its origin
- Mirror Z=True means it extrudes in -Z from its origin
