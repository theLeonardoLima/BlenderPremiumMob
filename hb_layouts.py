        # When _compute_recursive_bbox calls obj.evaluated_get(depsgraph)
        # for descendants that aren't in that depsgraph, Blender falls back
        # to the unevaluated copy whose parent-chain transforms haven't

        # wall.matrix_world.inverted(), that polluted origin becomes a
        # wall-local point at (-W.t.x, -W.t.y, 0) — i.e. it scales with

        IS_FRAMELESS_INTERIOR_PART) into a dashed-content collection.

        MultiView instances ONE content collection per cell and links
        every instance into SOLID freestyle, so interior parts -- present
        in the content but occluded -- get no SOLID strokes and no DASHED
        pass either, and never draw. ElevationView avoids this by splitting
        each cabinet into solid / dashed sub-collections
        (_collect_objects_split). Here we build ONE dashed collection for
        the whole source and instance it (front elevation cell only) into
        DASHED freestyle.

        Interior parts are MOVED out of the solid content, not copied.
        Blender freestyle selects by SOURCE object, so leaving a shared
        interior part in BOTH the solid content (instanced at every cell)
        and the dashed content marks that source object 'dashed'
        EVERYWHERE it's instanced -- the shelves then draw dashed on the
        plan and iso cells too, not just the elevation. Removing them from
        solid content (mirroring _collect_objects_split exactly) leaves
        them only in the front dashed instance. Behind-door parts are
        hidden on every cell anyway, so the solid cells lose nothing.
        Only parts behind a real front are moved -- open-shelving
        parts (open opening) stay in solid content so they remain
        VISIBLE / solid on the iso and plan cells (see occluded()).
